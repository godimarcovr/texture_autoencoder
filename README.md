# Experimental texture autoencoder + classification

### Marco Godi

## Description
An attempt to build a fully convolutional neural network based autoencoder which is also able to classify texture.


## Requirements
Install pytorch 0.4 on python 3.6
Download the [DTD](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/) dataset and save the images/ folder from the downloaded archive as dtd/ folder in the project.

## Results
Not good for now, some degree of success on autoencoder mode only with only a 4x dimension reduction.
